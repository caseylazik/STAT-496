STAT 496 Project

Authors - Casey Lazik, Harry Schuckman

Project Idea: What affects resume evaluation? - Give the LLM many resumes varied in certain
ways(our variables we are testing) and ask it to rate the strength of the resume or if it would
recommend it or some way of evaluating it. Could vary job descriptions/industries as well.


We can create resumes such that we are able to control for variables, and avoid potential privacy issues.


This project also analyzes racial biases present in LLMs, which are used by companies when deciding candidates for job positions
For this reason we believe its of utmost importance to discuss these problems while also trying our best to be
considerate of the generated data we use (particularly names).
