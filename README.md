Project: What affects resume evaluation? - Give the LLM many resumes varied on certain
their contents and ask it to rate the strength of the resume or if it would
recommend it or some way of evaluating it. We generate our resumes using LLMs.


We create resumes such that we are able to control for variables, and avoid potential privacy issues. We generated 5,040 resumes to ensure we had
a decently large amount while also being feasible for runtime.


This project also analyzes racial biases present in LLMs, which are used by companies when deciding candidates for job positions
For this reason we believe its of utmost importance to discuss these problems while also trying our best to be
considerate of the generated data we use (particularly names).
