Over the past weak or so, we have started our output analysis as well as responded to some given feedback. Specifically, we addressed the issue of race/sex - based bias that could have come about by including the names in the LLM prompt to generate the resumes. We now simply add the names to the resumes afterward, using a placeholder in generation. Additionally, we updated our output to include the data of each resume, rather than just the resume_id. This allows for more clarity. Regarding our output analysis progress, we have generated all 5040 resumes, as well as a chunk of the output (evaluations). We ran some statistical tests on this and will do a final review before we generate the rest of the data, to ensure there isn't anything we want to change.
