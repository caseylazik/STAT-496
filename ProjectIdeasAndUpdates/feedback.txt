This text file's purpose is to write down ideas and record feedback we have addressed:





Feedback to address from each other or professor:

- Consider bias from order (order of input to LLM can change things quite a bit)


Addressed Feedback:

- Improved Resume detail (use LLM to generate them)
- Included more jobs
- Less bullet-pointed requirements for a job
- More varied names generated using Harvard database
- Not describing education as just a level of degree
- Rank the resumes on an ordered scale rather than simply approve or not
- Reversed order of decision/explanation such that the explanation comes first
- Removed race/sex bias from generating the resumes with the names in LLM input, instead place string after the LLM gives its output (saves time too)
- Added the resume details (rather than only resume_id) to each output in output.csv and included the race/sex variables concretely
